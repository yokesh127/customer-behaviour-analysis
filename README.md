Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboarding 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data extraction, analysis, cleaning, querying, visualization, and reporting. The goal is to transform raw data into actionable business insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

The project showcases practical skills commonly expected from Data Analyst / Business Analyst roles, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), database querying, and dashboard creation.

📂 Dataset

Source: Public / Sample / Business dataset (replace with actual source if applicable)
